Grand Staircase Escalante National Monument (what a mouthful!) is the furthest east we traveled on this trip. I didn't know a whole lot about the area but decided to check it out since we have never been there before and its pretty close to Bryce Canyon, where we also wanted to go. During our couple days here, we went on these 2 hikes:

## Lower Calf Creek Falls

If you look at any guide for best hikes at GSE, then you'll find this one at the top of the list. And for good reason! There is a beautiful waterfall at the end of the very scenic hike. The hike is about 6 mi in and out. We started it around 5pm and walking briskly, finished a little after 7:30pm before sunset. There was another family who was just *beginning* the hike as we left (wtf?)...I would not recommend this! We almost got lost on the way back by taking a wrong turn, and the best scenes like the waterfall will be unviewable in the dark. Tip: make sure you know when sun sets so that you can make it back in time before dark! We always hike with a headtorch now (they are SO handy) - would highly recommend for any low-light situation. The elevation was also pretty easy...aside from a few short but steep areas, the land was flat. After hiking Dead Woman's Pass on the Inca Trail, I feel like I can conquer any steep climb now!

## Willis Creek Slot Canyon

This hike that we did was actually Plan C...Plan A was to hike the Zebra Slot Canyon. When I found out that the canyon was filled with waist-deep water, I figured we could do the alterntaive Peekaboo and Spooky Gulch Canyons. We made our way over there and learned that our little sedan was not cut out to drive on the gravelly, unpaved Hole-in-the-rock Road. We were going 14 mph and our bones were still rattling all over the place. We noticed that most people drove large vans or trucks and they were able to go twice our speed. After 7 miles of this agonizing speed (and shaking) with 20 more to go, I felt like we had to pivot. I wasn't sure if our little rental car was going to make it and it would sure suck if we had car troubles out in the *middle of nowhere*. So! If you plan to do any hikes along Hole-in-the-rock Road, then I would suggest driving a 4x4 or rent an ATV? Small jeep? Which we saw plenty of on our drive back. The nearby city Escalante has them for rent.

As a result, we made our way over to Willis Creek to do a slot canyon hike. It seems like GSE has plenty of them! You will still have to drive in unpaved dirt roads to get to the trailhead but at least it was only 3 mi vs 20 mi of it. I was pleasantly surprised by what a fun, unique hike it was! You are actually within the slot canyons, hiking along the creek. Many places still had ice over the creek! My Texan eyes could not believe there was snow out there in March! Especially not under the sun! But that day was actually quite cold - high of 46 deg.

It was a good thing that the ice hadn't completely melted yet. I imagine that when it does, the hike will be much harder to do with higher water levels. You'll probably have to wade through a stream to complete it, like the Zion Narrows. With the water levels low, this was an easy hike where we could easy jump across the stream where we needed to. There were also plenty of young kids (and dogs)! It made us wonder just how young can kids go on hikes? Let us know!
