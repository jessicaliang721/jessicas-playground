Grand Staircase Escalante National Monument (what a mouthful!) is the furthest east we traveled on this trip. I didn't know a whole lot about the area but decided to check it out since we have never been there before and its pretty close to Bryce Canyon, where we also wanted to go. During our couple days here, we went on these 2 hikes:

## Lower Calf Creek Falls

If you look at any guide for best hikes at GSE, then you'll find this one at the top of the list. And for good reason! There is a beautiful waterfall at the end of the very scenic hike. The hike is about 6 mi in and out. We started it around 5pm and walking briskly, finished a little after 7:30pm before sunset. There was another family who was just *beginning* the hike as we left (wtf?)...I would not recommend this! We almost got lost on the way back by taking a wrong turn, and the best scenes like the waterfall will be unviewable in the dark. Tip: make sure you know when sun sets so that you can make it back in time before dark! We always hike with a headtorch now (they are SO handy) - would highly recommend for any low-light situation. The elevation was also pretty easy...aside from a few short but steep areas, the land was flat. After hiking Dead Woman's Pass on the Inca Trail, I feel like I can conquer any steep climb now!

## Willis Creek Slot Canyon

This other hike that we did was actually
