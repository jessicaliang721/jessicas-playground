With the [Stardew Valley board game](https://www.stardewvalley.net/stardew-valley-the-board-game-available-now/) coming out, my interest in the game has renewed! I actually bought the computer game a while ago. Its cute graphics and relaxing farming theme highly appealed to me.

However, I was overwhelmed by how-to and beginner guides. I felt the need to maximize ALL potential events and resources! If I missed an event in the year or didn't accomplish X goal, I felt like I failed the entire game. As a result, I stopped playing. This all-or-nothing mentality is certainly *insane.* Obviously this is *just a game*, not to mention that is supposed to be relaxing! Yes, I know I need to chill the hell out.

So this time around, I bought the game again for the Switch (and HB gets my computer game). I'm coming into it with a more relaxed mindset. The goal is for me to explore the Valley, take care of my little farm, and most importantly, **not look at any guides.** After playing Animal Crossing for a while and getting bored with it, I'm hoping that this game will be a nice replacement. I also like how the game is on a portable console like the Switch, which allows me to pick up and play a little at a time. I'm known for binging a computer game then not touching them again for a year...

I'm also pretty excited by the multi-player mode. My husband and I could build a little farm together, if we wanted to! I haven't explored that option yet but when I created my new farm I made sure to [create a few extra cabins](https://www.gamesradar.com/stardew-valley-co-op-multiplayer-how-to/) so that we could play together in the future. This was the only guide I read, I promise! :grimacing: It does seem like we need two sets of controllers though. I was looking at getting a pair of cheaper, off-brand Switch controllers like [these](https://amzn.to/30rx2yN). Any thoughts?

Finally, I'm doing all this so that when I get my hands on a copy of the board game, everything will be familiar to me. The board game looks beautiful and high quality. Just look at these tokens! :heart_eyes:

I cannot wait to try it. It is NOT a short game though because it takes ~45min/player. So who has the patience and wants to play with us?!

**Are you a Stardew Valley player? What do you think about the game? And if you have the board game, I would love to know your initial thoughts about it!**
