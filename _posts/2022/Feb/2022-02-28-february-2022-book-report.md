A shorter month, but that does not mean less books! With the trips to Denver and Vegas I took this month, I had plenty of time to kill in airports and hotels, which I did by reading. Once again, I am so grateful for my new [Kindle](https://amzn.to/34RBj4k)! It's small, compact, and long-lasting battery. It's been great for travel.

## All the Ugly and Wonderful Things

Little did I know, I read this book already until I was halfway through it. My memory is the worst, haha! But I still read it as if it were my first time, because I forgot everything that happened. I liked the nontraditional love story that was both pure and steamy! What a rollercoaster of emotions this book took me on. Empathy, longing, sadness, and hope, this book made me feel it all.

## The Four Winds

This was the first book I've ever read that was set during the Great Depression. For that reason, it was very interesting how the author imagined what living during that time would've been like. It also gave me insight into migrant workers' lives - how it was a struggle then, and is still a struggle now. But my God, the entire book was *sad.* It was doom and gloom all throughout. Do not read this book if you are feeling down! It also took me a while to like the main character. For that reason, this book doesn't get full marks from me.

## The Road Back to You

This book gave good insight into the 9 different personality types (that the author claims everyone falls into). But honestly, I'm not going to remember what each number is/corresponds to. I have little to takeaway from this book besides snippets I remember about my own enneagram number. The book also felt a little horoscope-y to me... which is weird because the book talks about how knowing your enneagram number should help you grow closer to other people and to God. Decent self-help book, but it sure was no *Atomic Habits*!

## Maybe You Should Talk to Someone

I love a good memoir, and this one was so uniquely written by a therapist who writes about her experiences going to a therapist as well as anecdotes about her own clients' sessions. Having gone to counseling before, this was like a peek into the secret lives of therapists. Oh, so that's what my counselor was probably thinking when I said xyz! The stories the author related made me laugh and cry. A good book makes me feel, and this one sure did. It also made me consider going back to counseling, so that's a pretty big win.

## The Book of Longings

When I first read the synopsis, I wondered if I was reading something sacriligious. A story about Jesus's wife?! But I accepted the book as a work of fiction, and it was a beautiful. I liked the way the author weaved in historical events with fictional storytelling. It definitely made me see Jesus through a more lighthearted lens - I mean come on, we never see him laugh or smile or joke in the Bible!
