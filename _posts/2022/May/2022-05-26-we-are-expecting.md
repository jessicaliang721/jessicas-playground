Some days I still cannot believe it! I'm 14 weeks pregnant right now and all I have to show for it is a bloated stomach. :laughing: I am delighted to share the big news exactly one year after [we moved into our new house]({% post_url /2021/Apr/2021-04-24-we-are-moving %}), on our anniversary no less!

*8 weeks pregnant*

During most of my first trimester I was super worried that for some reason, I was going to lose the baby. After our somewhat difficult journey to conceive (my heart goes out to all the couples who have experienced this), I feared that this was too good to be true. That somehow this wonderful gift would suddenly be taken away from me. This one time I felt a gush coming out of my vagina. I was terrified of going to the bathroom and seeing blood on my panties. Turns out it was just a gush of discharge - it's normal for pregnancy people to produce more! The entire time was an exercise of both thanking God but also relinquishing control to Him. Whatever happens, happens - God is good, all the time.

But after my 8th week sonogram where I saw my baby grow to have a head (and a butt!) from the tiny grain of rice it was at 6 weeks, I felt a bit of relief. It's really growing inside of me! What made it most real was hearing the loud and quick ba-dump ba-dump of its heartbeat. The entire time I said to my midwife, "I can't believe this is real!"

*It's starting to take shape!*

Now that I'm in my second trimester, I feel a tiny bit more relaxed. Enough to share the news with my coworkers! But I still have sooome inkling of doubt. I read about other people's devastating losses at 20, 24 weeks on the internet (why do I do this to myself?). I look forward to every single doctor's visit to hear the reassurance of the baby's heartbeat. I'm always a little surprised to hear it going strong! HB and I thank God every day for my relatively good health, mild pregnancy symptoms, and a developing baby. I want this to be my first thought in the morning when I wake up: "I'm grateful to be alive. I'm grateful that my child is growing."

To distract myself from worries, I've been going down the YouTube rabbit hole of parenting, newborn "must-haves," and birthing videos. My new hobbies also include designing my kid's nursery (more on this soon to come!) and putting together our baby registry. :grin: You can say that I'm nesting pretty hard right now. Every weekend is dedicated to home projects, shopping for the baby, and getting the nursery set up. HB has been super supportive in this regard - but I wonder when he'll want to quit the shopping! One my favorite moments was picking out children's books together. We get to share our favorite stories like Corduroy, The Giving Tree, and Charlotte's Web with our kid.

I'd love to hear how your pregnancy journey was/is going. Let's catch up over a cuppa!
