I'm waaay behind on my monthly book reports, but I'm trying to catch up! Here's what I read in May:

## The Innocent

Rating: ★★★/5

It was a quick, easy mystery to get through. I was happy with it up until the very end when I read the story's "twist." I didn't like the twist and I wasn't particularly fond of some of the characters. I did, though, like the main character Matt. Quick, fun read - good book to take while traveling.

## The Maidens
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1250304458?ie=UTF8&SubscriptionId=1MGPYB6YW3HWK55XCGG2&linkCode=li3&tag=jessicapei-20&linkId=36e9546c018e6ab09eef9d56b4899542&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_il" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=1250304458&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=jessicapei-20&language=en_US" ></a><img src="https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=jessicapei-20&language=en_US&l=li3&o=1&a=1250304458" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />
Rating: ★★★/5

Oh my god this story could've had so much potential. A handsome and charming professor? Secret society of female students? It's a story ripe for scandal! And though there was scandal in the story (just not how I imagined), once again, I didn't really care for the main character Mariana. Honestly she just seemed mopey 80% of the time. 

## Raising An Emotionally Intelligent Child
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0684838656?ie=UTF8&SubscriptionId=1MGPYB6YW3HWK55XCGG2&linkCode=li3&tag=jessicapei-20&linkId=781b5fa36b5b1c1b2251ff80c80e29ac&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_il" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=0684838656&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=jessicapei-20&language=en_US" ></a><img src="https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=jessicapei-20&language=en_US&l=li3&o=1&a=0684838656" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />
Rating: ★★★★/5

My therapist actually recommended this one to me. Turns out, the concepts are ones that I can apply to myself too - having a kid  forces me to rediscover my inner child. I need to be able to emotion coach (regulate) myself before I can teach it to my kid! Chapters 1-5 were the most helpful that were full of good examples. I'll definitely have to revisit this book once my kid reaches the toddler years. :grimacing:

## The Housemaid
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09TWSRMCB?ie=UTF8&SubscriptionId=1MGPYB6YW3HWK55XCGG2&linkCode=li3&tag=jessicapei-20&linkId=49f050276f99f5189e988bed9559f732&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_il" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B09TWSRMCB&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=jessicapei-20&language=en_US" ></a><img src="https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=jessicapei-20&language=en_US&l=li3&o=1&a=B09TWSRMCB" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />
Rating: ★★★★/5

Oooh this was a delicious read. I randomly found it on Kindle Unlimited where elements of the story - bored housewife, handsome husband, pretty new maid - (heck yes, let's read about more scandals!) appealed to me. Turns out it was also a thriller with a juicy plot twist at the end. This time, the twist was deliciously dark and fun. This would also be a great vacation (beach) read.

## A Court of Thorns and Roses
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1635575567?ie=UTF8&SubscriptionId=1MGPYB6YW3HWK55XCGG2&linkCode=li3&tag=jessicapei-20&linkId=58178082aa5b6dbecfc5589b9113d312&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_il" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=1635575567&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=jessicapei-20&language=en_US" ></a><img src="https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=jessicapei-20&language=en_US&l=li3&o=1&a=1635575567" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

I wanted to read this after hearing it on A Beautiful Mess book report. When I looked it up on Goodreads, it turns out I *already read it* years ago! It was that forgettable, HAHA! But ok, let's give it another shot since sooo many (women?) love this series. Turns out, the main character was just as dull as I remembered her. But I kept going because some parts are really hawt :kissing_heart: Maybe the following books in the series will be better.
