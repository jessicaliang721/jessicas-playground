I dip my toe into drawing or painting maybe once a year. During Christmas, I paint people cards, and that seems to be the only time I paint during the year now! I would like to get in the habit of making art more frequently. But I also don't want to be intimidated by beautiful yet ambitious art projects. Therefore, I've been searching for some easy art doodles or paintings I can do in less than 30 minutes - 1 hr. Here are some of my favorite Youtube Channels for making easy art:

## [Shayda Campbell](https://www.youtube.com/c/ShaydaCampbell/search?query=doodle)

She's my favorite bullet journaler, but her bujo designs and setups are way too intimidating for me! Instead, I like following her easy doodle tutorials. Florals and foliage are the best ones.

## [Nianiani](https://www.youtube.com/c/Nianiani)

Her watercolor tutorials are nice and short (most are ~20 min long). Each project may take about 1+ hrs to complete in real time though. The subject matter of her paintings are just my vibe (there's a lot of plants)! All of the pieces are very vibrant and colorful; just what I like.

## [Let's Make Art](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFJlM_wj9UyffyTuW6UZlkTZmn0Ufslfz)

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mWRsZxw5kx0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

This was the channel that started it all for me! I got into a watercolor frenzy at the end of 2019. I wanted to paint EVERYTHING on the channel because Sarah makes it look so easy! But because I did so much so fast, I also got sick of it. I did not touch watercolor until the following year with my Christmas cards! But whenever I want to make a big piece (that's nice enough to frame), I turn to this channel to find a project.

She's another bullet journaler, but I like some of the doodles she does. Not as many doodle tutorials on her channel, but it's easy to get doodle inspiration from looking through her bullet journals.

## Art Supplies

Since I'm a novice and only practice art as a hobby, I own starter art supplies. But don't let that fool you! These beginner kits may be cheap, but the quality is still there! These are the watercolors and pens I use for my doodles and paintings:
