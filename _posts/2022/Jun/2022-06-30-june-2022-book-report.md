Not too much reading happened this month...because I rediscovered [my love for Animal Crossing]({{ site.baseurl}}{% post_url /2022/Jun/2022-06-24-reimagining-animal-crossing-island %}) and played that during most of my free time! But I at least finished my book club book "Mexican Gothic" in time for June's meeting. So that's something!

Rating: ★★★/5

This is book 2 of the Court of Thorns and Roses series. Remember how [I forgot that I read book 1]({{ site.baseurl}}{% post_url /2022/May/2022-05-31-may-2022-book-report %}), and when I re-read it, the story was still pretty mediocre? Well at the time I don't think book 2 was out, so I never continued the series. Now that I finished book 2, I think I've decided that this is just not for me. The main character is "meh" where I don't like her but I also don't hate her. The story isn't super captivating. I began book 3 but couldn't finish past 100 pages. It's time to sunset this series, no matter how much I wanted to like it.

Up until about 75%, this book was slooooow. It felt so hard to get through because it felt like the plot was just not moving quickly enough. I did end up liking the snooty main character a bit more as it went on, but also didn't love her. Finally after 3/4 of the book, the pace picked up. It picked up so much that one night when I couldn't fall back asleep at 3am, I dug into this book and nearly finished it! The plot twist was a pretty unique idea. I also didn't expect it to be so dark, but I guess the "gothic" part of the name should've given it away.

Yet another productivity book. It made a good argument for why you'd want to break down your goals into 12 week chunks instead of an overall "New Year's Resolution." But I can't remember a single actionable take-away from this. It at least prompted me to look up YT vids on productivity instead. In fact, [this YouTube video](https://youtu.be/AgIggrkBFcU) was more helpful for giving practical tips on how to stay focused during work.
