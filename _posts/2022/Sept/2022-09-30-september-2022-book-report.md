This pregnancy has forced me to take things slow. I get tired easily and just want to lay down all the time. As a result, I have been doing much less on the weekends and reading at home instead! So I devoured a good number of books this month.

Rating: ★★★☆☆

Fun, light read - perfect to take on vacation. Some of the romance felt a little cliche, but not too bad. As the author said in the author's note, she wanted to explore the story of the ex-girlfriend - the city-dweller who ends up being dumped when the boyfriend goes to a small town and meets the "love of his life." Also. I can't help but imagine Trent Crimm (",Independent") from Ted Lasso as the face of the main male character!

## Killing Eve: Codename Villanelle

Rating: ★★★★☆

I thoroughly enjoyed this book, but perhaps it's also because I loved the show. Except for that unfortunate last season, where after I finished it, thought "that's it?!" and had to get a more satisfying ending. This is how I found out about this book series that the show was based on. It gave a better/more clear backstory to how Villanelle became an assassin. I liked the more detailed character development!

## Expecting Better: Why the Conventional Pregnancy Wisdom Is Wrong--and What You Really Need to Know

Rating: ★★★☆☆

An interesting, data-driven read around different pregnancy topics (alcohol, smoking, miscarriage, etc.). But I was still skeptical about some of the data she presented - like how you can have alcohol when pregnant, just don't binge. Personally, I remembered more things and had more takeaways from Bumpin' (see my last book report) than this. But some of the data around miscarriage rates were reassuring and could've come in handy for peace of mind during early pregnancy.

## The Song of Achilles

Rating: ★★★★☆

Turns out this is a pretty old book that I just now heard of. The storytelling reminded me a lot of Circe, the other popular, reimagined Greek mythology story by the same author. This is a good sign, because it means the author does a good job of being consistent with her writing style, giving these characters a back story and bringing them to "life." The retelling of Achilles's life and love was an entertaining, quick read, with a surprising end to how Achilles died.

## The Starless Sea

Rating: ★★☆☆☆

This is the second time I have attempted to read this book, and once again, I just could not finish it. It is a story that could've been everything that I like and want (fantasy, magic, some romance) but I think the descriptions were too lengthy. I got bored, where at times my mind wandered while I was reading. I'm pretty disappointed with how this turned out, especially since I loved the author's other book "The Night Circus."

## The Happiest Baby on the Block

I actually got this book for free from a baby swag bag, and had no intention of reading it, but my husband picked it up and found some good nuggets of information in it. Then it was my turn to read! Turns out, learning about the 5 s's to calm a crying baby could be a very useful tool for when the day comes. Some parts of the book are a bit outdated - still promoting "breast is best" when all you really need is a fed baby. But having this knowledge gives us both hope that when the time comes, we can put the techniques into practice, or at least know what to desperately Google!
