Just as the title says - we're going on a national parks trip to the Southwest USA this next week! It has been more than a year since we last traveled, and I think we're ready to get out. Our last trip was to Peru in Oct 2019, back when everything was "normal." This time around, our travels will be quite different as we take more precautions to protect ourselves against COVID. Hello, face shields!

We are actually no strangers to the American southwest. In fact, we took a trip together there in 2017 and that's where we got engaged!

It was certainly an unforgettable trip of a lifetime. But as it is with all trips, it was way too short. I am looking forward to going back to some of my favorite national parks this time around. We will be revisiting Zion and Bryce Canyon National Park. But to add on to the list, we'll also go to Joshua Tree, Valley of Fire, and Grand Staircase Escalante. Our points of interest are mapped out down below:

It'll also be a whirlwind of a trip where we are trying to see as much as we can in a week. I don't know about you, but I like to sight-see as much as I can while traveling. We are going to go on long, all-day hikes during this trip. I don't even remember when was the last time I had a vacation where all I did was relax. Save the sleep for home!

Of course, COVID risks will still be at the back of my mind as we travel. I suspect that we will never look at large crowds the same way again! The irony is that Texas is administering the vaccine to everyone *while we are gone.* Hah. But I don't want to live my life in fear. It'll have to be a balance of caution and fulfillment on my part. Hopefully we will be able to stay safe on this trip and make it back in one piece. Your prayers are appreciated!!

**Have you been to some of these parks before? What were your favorite activities there?**
