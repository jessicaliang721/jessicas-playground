Sparks Joy is a monthly roundup of people, experiences, or things that brought joy or value for me during this time. It's like practicing gratitude, but I can geek about them here online with other people!

## New TV

*LG 86" Class - UN8570 Series - [get it at Costco](https://bit.ly/3wwuoqk)*

Call us crazy, but right after we got back from our national parks trip, we ordered ourselves a nice, big, 86" TV. We had been getting hand-me-downs from our families up until this point. Over the last year, we realized that BOY do we watch/use the TV a lot. So it was time for an upgrade, and I couldn't be happier. It was definitely tricky mounting the 100 pound beast onto the wall. But now I can see all my captions at like, 100pt font! :smile: I've been enjoying copious amounts of TV and movies and playing Switch games on it this month.

## My new betta fish, Salmon

Salmon was really shy the first few days I got him. He only hung around the back of the tank and I always had trouble finding him! After a week or so, he got used to my presence and will come out and swim near me when I'm at my desk. It is such a joy to watch him when I need a break from staring at my computer! I'll definitely share my full desk setup soon. In the meantime, here's more information about [my tank]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2021-04-06-my-biorb-aquarium-setup-supplies %}).

## Dreaming about our new home
In case you missed the big announcement, We Are Moving! Ever since our dream became a reality, my mind has gone into overdrive daydreaming and imagining how I want to decorate this new space. I have been having a blast creating mood boards so that I can give my brain (and HB's ears) a relief, lol. Sometimes it's fun to dream even if it might not turn into anything concrete. It's part of the creative process!

Check out some of the mood boards I have created [here](/tag/decor).

## Playing Spiritfarer

I had talked about this game in detail in [this post](% post_url 2021-04-21-spiritfarer %), but I have really been enjoying playing Spiritfarer. The more I play, the more "stuff" I feel like I have to do! Sometimes it's a little overwhelming and when that happens then I just give myself a break. And remember that I don't have to do everything; it's a game for heaven's sake! Otherwise, it has been a fun way to wind down at the end of the day.

**What sparked joy for you this month?**
