We have finally moved into our new home and this month was all about buying furniture and home goods! Here's what I picked up that Sparked Joy for me this month:

## Electric candle lighter
I had *no idea* this was a thing until I saw bloggers using and recommending them. Since they're pretty cheap, I bought one to try. To my satisfaction, it is extremely easy to use and works! I will find any excuse to light a candle now.

## Emerald velvet curtains
I am so happy with the quality of these gorgeous emerald velvet curtains I got for my office. They are heavy, lined, and black-out. I know that quality curtains can be really expensive, but these were very reasonably priced on Amazon. Could not believe how good they are! I am now going to get some from this brand for every room of our house!

## Outlet shelf
This was another one of those things I didn't know I needed, but after getting one, has improved my quality of life. I installed one in my bathroom, set my Echo on it, and now I can hear my music loud and clear when I shower. Love it!

## Wooden monitor stand
The reason why I got this monitor stand was to hide  my unsightly keyboard and mouse cords. Plus, I can stash random notepads and trinkets in the little pull-out drawers. It was surprisingly good quality, joined with dove-tailed joints and made of solid wood. It can even hold up my gigantic/heavy 34" monitor without bowing!

## Headphone stand
Ok this seems like an extremely extra purchase, but I realized I needed one after working from home this last year. My headphones were always thrown on the desk without a proper place to hang or store it. After finding this GORGEOUS head phone stand, I knew it would fit my desk aesthetic! Not only does it look good, but it is also sturdy and doesn't tip.

## Ikea Feather Pillows

Guys, these are SO GOOD. I didn't know about feather-filled throw pillows until I started watching Youtube designers. THESE are the goodies that we should all be investing in. I paired them with [these pillow covers](https://amzn.to/3xi6HBB) and together, they are *chef's kiss.* They feel good and look good!

It's been crazy this month moving in and getting our house in order. Plus, I had to start going back to the office, so it was changes all around. We had to deal with several misshaps including a kitchen flood...but we're a bit more settled now and look forward to inviting friends and family over to our new home!
