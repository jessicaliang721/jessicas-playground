I've had a lot of time to listen to podcasts while moving into our new home and painting the walls of our media room! I got a good chunk of listening in this weekend as I spent hours painting the room. Here are a couple of episodes that I recently listened to and enjoyed:

## Unlocking Us With Brene Brown

### Brene with Priya Parker on The Art of Gathering

This one made me re-think how and why we gather. What's the point of throwing a baby shower, wedding, or dinner party? When we think about our intentions for the event, then we can begin to throw them more authentically. We don't *have* to follow the same-old formats and can invent our own traditions! Definitely keeping this in mind for the next get-together we have.

### Brene with David Eagleman on The Inside Story of the Ever-Changing Brain

Honestly, I would not have chosen to listen to this on my own, but since it was the next episode on autoplay to the one I mentioned above, I was surprisingly delighted by this interview. Eagleman is a neuroscientist whose enthusiasm for the brain clearly shows! My number one takeaway is that I need to continually challenge myself with new skills. This is the best way to stave off symptoms of Alzheimers. We all know this, but...I could be more comfortable with discomfort!

## The Confessional with Nadia Bolz-Weber

### Episode: Megan Phelps-Roper, Former Member of Westboro Baptist Church

Holy moly what an introduction to the Confessional podcast, where people share things they did that they are not proud of. It was fascinating listening to this former member of the Westboro Baptist church share about her hateful past and how she received compassion through the people of Twitter, of all places. As it turns out, social media *can* be used for good!

## Dolly Parton's America

### She's Alive

This is the last episode to Dolly Parton's America and it was my favorite one. I liked hearing Dolly's take on her faith and how she found God. I resonated a lot with how she feels and sees God all around her all the time, not just at a church. Most of all, I love how she is not pushy with her faith but just shares about her own experiences.

## A Beautiful Mess Podcast

### #94: Summer Bucket List

I look forward to new episodes of this podcast every week, and this week was no different. Even though this podcast is talking about summer-y thing to try/do this season, my favorite tidbit was at the end. Guest host Laura talked about her own experience renovating a home as a perfectionist. You can't wait until your home is "done" to make memories! So true; a much-needed reminder for a perfectionist like me!

## Dr. Death

All I could think about when listening to this docu-series was "holy shit." Over and over again. Hearing about how this crazy-ass doctor performed 30+ surgeries, maiming patients and permanently disabling them, before anybody stopped him. Worse, it was here in my own city, Dallas! This episode was the most frustrating one to listen to as we hear fellow doctors trying to stop this psychopathic neurosurgeon to no avail and what it took for someone to finally step in.
