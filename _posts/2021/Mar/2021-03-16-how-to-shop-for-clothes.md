It never occurred to me until I started reading [The Curated Closet](https://amzn.to/3rjUwli) that there is a correct way to shop for clothes. Only when I read its "THIRTEEN questions to ask oneself before making a purchase" did it dawn on me that most of my clothes were bought on a whim. Let's take a look at how to shop for clothes that you will *love* and wear over and over again!

![trying on clothes]({{ page.image }})

The very first thing you want to do is make a shopping list. Hopefully after reading the previous Curated Closet post [on closet composition]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url /2021/Mar/2021-03-13-closet-composition-101 %}) you did this already.

But just as a recap, here are key factors to consider when writing a shopping list:
- Overall style
- Color
- Cut, silhouette, and fit
- Material
- Details
- Sleeve length
- Neckline
- Pattern

For example, one of the items on my list was a **black, leather cropped moto jacket**. Be as specific as possible! Get in the habit of deciding what you want to buy before you hit the shops, online or in person at a brick-and-mortar store.

## When to Buy and When To Keep Looking
Now here's a checklist of 13 questions you want to ask yourself as you are shopping:

### Style
1\. Does this piece reflect my personal style?  
2\. Do I like how it looks on my body?

### Function
3\. Can I think of a clear role for this item within my wardrobe?  
4\. Does it work with my lifestyle, and do I know exactly which type of activities I could wear it for?  
5\. Is it mixable?

### Quality
6\. Does it fit well and is it comfortable?  
7\. Is the garment well-constructed and made from a high-quality material?  
8\. Am I prepared to properly take care of this item?
   
### Budget
9\. Will this piece fill a gap in my wardrobe or only add to an already overrepresented area?  
10\. Is buying this piece a good use of my budget, or would a different item make a bigger impact on my wardrobe right now?  
11\. Do I want to buy this because itâ€™s on sale or I need a pick-me-up, want to celebrate, or am just plain bored?
    
### Gut
12\. Can I think of at least three concrete outfits I could create with this piece that I would be excited to wear?  
13\. Can I see myself wearing this for many seasons?

BOY do I struggle with number 11!

## Clothes that fit well
Obviously, it is a lot easier to buy items in stores. You can feel the garment quality and more importantly, try it on. Here's how you can tell if the clothing fits well:

**A piece with a good fit**
- hangs on your body just as the designer intended it to
- feels comfortable and allows you to move freely
- stays put without having to be readjusted

**A piece with a bad fit**
- looks distorted and may be too tight in some places but too loose in others
- digs into your skin, feels uncomfortably tight, and restricts your movement
- slips down, pulls, gaps, wrinkles, or bunches up as you move and needs to be constantly tucked back into place

### Mirror Check
Something I never did while trying clothes (but now do!) is step 2 of the mirror check:

1. Try on your piece in front of a full-length mirror and inspect it top to bottom. 
    - Does it look as it should? Or could your crop top be mistaken for a baggy tank top?
    - Is there any creasing, pulling on the seams, or sagging? Pay special attention to the shoulders of tops, jackets, and dresses and the waistband and crotch area of pants and skirts.
    - Does the waistband fit snugly around your body? Or is it too tight, loose, or unsupportive?
2. Movement Check
    - Hug someone (or pretend to).
    - Sit down.
    - Walk.
    - Bend over (as if you were tying your shoes).
   
Stay tuned, because in the next post, we're going shopping! I put together a list of all of my favorite stores to shop online from in the comfort of my home. It's finally time to crack that wallet open, baby!
