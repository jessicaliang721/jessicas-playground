It's finally time to go shopping! Hopefully by now, you've made a [detailed shopping list]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2021-03-16-how-to-shop-for-clothes %}) and know exactly what you're looking for. Thanks to this pandemic, I had to buy most of my new wardrobe online. It's kind of awesome but also kind of stressful because the possibilities are endless! I narrowed down my choices by selecting new pieces from the following stores. They are my tried and true favorites!

## Express

This was a surprise. I never thought I'd end up liking Express so much. I used to think it was only good for club-wear and fancy work clothes. As it turns out, it's my go-to for stylish basics - meaning basics with a bit of flair to them.

**What to get:** basic neutral-colored sweaters, cami tops, fancier short-sleeves, trendy blazers

Once they start selling summer clothes, I'll be on the lookout for high-waisted shorts here!

## Gap and Old Navy

I lump these guys together because they're under the same corp anyway. They're my go-to places to find the most basic of basics.

**What to get:** basic cotton t-shirts, simple leather belts, jean jackets, basic button-downs, jeans

## Mango

Another surprise retailer. I had only been to one Mango store before in New York then walked out unimpressed. But I gave it a second chance when a number of fashion bloggers recommended a camel coat from there. As I perused the rest of their collection, I found more and more things I liked. They offer a lot of trendy pieces that can still be timeless enough to re-wear season after season.

**What to get:** sweaters and sweaterdresses with extra flair, outerwear

Saving the best for last! Costco has been my go-to place for all things comfort wear in 2020. They had so many great comfortable pieces at wonderful prices!

**What to get:** joggers + sweatshirts, undergarments, leggings, basic long-sleeves

## Others
Other online retailers that I keep an eye on are J Crew, Ann Taylor, LOFT, and Banana Republic. These guys are either a hit or miss, depending on what I am looking for.

When shopping online for clothes, it's important to find stores that have a good return policy. Many of these places offer free shipping and a 60-day return window because of covid. I try to nail my size + fit based on [TrueFit](https://www.truefit.com/en/Home) and online reviews, but that doesn't always work out. I have had to take advantage of generous return policies several times! I learned that it's important to ZOOM IN on the pictures, read reviews, and read the product description, otherwise you may not get what you expected.
