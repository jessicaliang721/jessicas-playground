One of my favorite rooms in our home is the game/media room. It's fun, colorful, and comfortable. We certainly spend a lot of time in here, and especially during this last year...it provided us a good amount of entertainment while we were stuck at home. Come on in; I'm excited to share our different interests/hobbies that can be seen throughout this room!

## Plants, plants, and more plants

Last summer, plants infiltrated our entire home! I went through a plant craze, and as a result, had to add more ways to grow/display them around the home. As you can see, they've taken up every inch of windowsill, so I added a couple of shelves to the wall. It was a simple DIY consisting of wood and brackets that I then spray-painted gold. I LOVE the additional space to display MORE plants! Since the windows are east-facing and next to a building, there's not enough light coming in throughout the day. So I added self-timer [grow lamps](https://amzn.to/3u4iKkG) to each shelf. The plants are loving all that light.

Another one of my favorite pieces in here is the Ikea greenhouse cabinet, which houses my humidity-loving, smaller plants! It's around 70% humidity inside the cabinet during the spring/summer. The only downside to my set-up is I sometimes forget to open the door to let in new air-flow, which causes some mold growth. I'm just going to have to remember to incorporate that into my morning routine in the future...

I had mentioned in my [April Sparks Joy post]({% post_url /2021/Apr/2021-04-30-april-2021-sparks-joy %}) that we upgraded our TV to [this big boy](https://amzn.to/2QUDBII) and I am LOVING it! My favorite evenings are ones where we can sit back, relax, and enjoy a show/movie under the glow of our Christmas lights. The TV's "smart" remote easily navigates to my favorite apps, so now I also watch a good amount of YouTube on the big screen. I've become a huuuge YT consumer after learning how to listen to videos on 2x speed with captions on! :laughing: This could be either a good or bad thing...

## Board Games

![board games](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/ACtC-3fu0ggeHYoXV9ks-aYHyho3uECJL2QlzjFW99aBxcjgEQ67BS4hBBodt_oOzDyLVk57rUmK5vQXHPlq2k3-NyqXYYuHv6cxN9BOKLDlBpwfgwfJzjnxXG91ptqYQzrNrvJdbQEuT-ckQNyuH6qD0XxKlg=w1000-h667-no?authuser=0)

It's kind of hard to miss our giant collection of board games... I had started collecting them after graduating from college, and lucky me, HB is into this hobby too. You can read more about this topic under the [board game tag](/tag/board-games). Everyone seems to use these [Ikea Kallax shelves](https://amzn.to/3gQCzZ0) to store their games, and I will say, it is probably the best/most economical solution. Additionally, I got these shelves thinking that they could eventually double as kids' toy storage. They're a kid-friendly height, and I love all the separated cubbies to display Montessori-style toys! :grinning:

I had intentionally designed this room as a play room with kids in mind. Hence, the bright, fun, colors. Good news is, a lot of the furniture and decor will translate into our new home's play room. I can't wait to share my ideas/mood board for that future play room, so stay tuned!
