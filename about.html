		<p>Hello, my name is Jessica. I am a <a href="https://www.jessicaliang.net/" target="_blank">software engineer</a> based in Dallas, TX. Outside of coding, I have a LOT of
			interests/hobbies! Some of them include traveling with my husband (who is called HB here on the blog),
			photography, crafting, house plant care, interior design, and playing board games. I blog about these and
			more! Explore the full list of my interests:</p>

		<p>I am a maker at heart, and this blog allows me to create a beautiful, joyful space to express my thoughts. If
			you want to see how I made this blog, check out <a href="{% link _posts/2021/Mar/2021-03-04-intro.md %}">this
				post</a>. I love to connect with like-minded people over shared interests/hobbies. So if you have a cool
			suggestion or want to talk about a shared hobby, please don't be shy! Drop me a comment in the post.</p>
