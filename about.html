		<p>Hello, my name is Jessica. I am a software engineer by day. Outside of coding, I have a LOT of interests/hobbies! Some of them include traveling with my husband, photography, crafting, house plant care, interior design, and playing board games. I blog about these and more on here!

		<p>I am a maker at heart, and this blog allows me to create a beautiful, joyful space to express my thoughts. If you want to see how I made this blog, check out <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2021-03-04-intro.md %}">this post</a>. I love to connect with like-minded people over shared interests/hobbies. So if you have a cool suggestion or want to talk about a shared hobby, please don't be shy! Drop me a message in the post's comment section.</p>
